# Aaron's Somewhat Daily Schedule

## Description

I like to keep track of how I spend my days and feel in control of my time management, which is exactly why I wanted to create this scheduler. The hardest part about creating this scheduler was getting the javascript to display the past, present, and future blocks to their proper color depending on what the time was while viewing it.
